# Binary Search and Linear Search Implementation

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the implementation of two fundamental searching algorithms: Binary Search and Linear Search. These algorithms are widely used for locating elements in datasets efficiently. The goal is to provide hands-on practice with core data structures while reinforcing the concepts of searching in computer science.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (if not already installed).

### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository:
  
   
2. Run the program:     bash
   python main.py
## *Purpose*
- *Linear Search*: A simple algorithm that scans each element of the list sequentially until the desired element is found or the list ends.
- *Binary Search*: A more efficient algorithm for sorted datasets that divides the search interval in half with each iteration.
## *Features*
- Implements both Linear Search and Binary Search.
- Handles edge cases like empty lists and elements not present in the list.
- Outputs the *worst-case complexity number* for Binary Search.
## *Time Complexity*

### *Linear Search*
- *Best Case*: \( O(1) \) (element found at the start of the list)
- *Worst Case*: \( O(n) \) (element not in the list or at the end)

### *Binary Search*
- *Best Case*: \( O(1) \) (element is the middle element)
- *Worst Case*: \( O(\log n) \) (element not in the list, requiring maximum divisions)

> *Note:* For Binary Search, the worst-case complexity is printed as a number representing \( \log_2(n) \), where \( n \) is the size of the list.
## *Example Output*
Here is a sample output of the program:


Enter the list of numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12
Enter the number to search: 10

Using Linear Search:
Element found at index 4
Time Complexity: O(n)

Using Binary Search:
Element found at index 4Time Complexity: O(log n)
Worst-case number: 3
